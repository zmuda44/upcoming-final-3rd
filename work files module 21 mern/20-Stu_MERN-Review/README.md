# üèóÔ∏è Implement Single-Thought Page Display

Work with a partner to implement the following user stories:

* As a user, I want to view a list of thoughts from all users of the application.

* As a user, I want to view individual thoughts and a list of comments.

* As an user, I want to be able to submit my own thoughts.

* As an user, I want to be able to submit my own comments on an individual thought.

## Acceptance Criteria

The activity is complete when the following criteria are met:

* When I load the homepage, I am shown a list of thoughts from every user of the application.

* When I attempt to submit a new thought, my information is accepted by the form and a new thought is displayed on the page.

* When I visit the individual thought page, I'm shown a single thought and its comments.

* When I attempt to submit a new comment on a thought page, my information is accepted by the form and displayed on the page.
