# 📖 Implement useReducer for a Component

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer I want to use a Hook to define and respond to actions in my app, allowing me to have better control over complex state changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have imported the actions I will use from the `/utils` folder into `StudentList.jsx`.

* It's done when I have used `studentContext` to read the global state from my Provider.

* It's done when I have implemented `onClick` actions for adding and removing students using `dispatch()`.

* It's done when the component renders correctly without errors in the browser.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

[React documentation on useReducer](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer)
