# üêõ Profile Page isn't Displaying the Logged in User's Data

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* As an authenticated user, I want my username to display on the profile link in the header.

* As a user, I want to see my own thoughts when I visit the profile page.

* As a user, I want to enter my thoughts and comments into the appropriate forms, and have my submitted data appear on the page.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when an authenticated user can see a link in the header which reflects their username.

* It is done when an authenticated user can navigate to the `/me` route and see their post history.

* It is done when a user can see their newly submitted thoughts display on the page.
