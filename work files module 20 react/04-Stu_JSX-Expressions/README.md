# 🏗️ Implement JSX Expressions

## Activity

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to use JSX expressions to render variables in my components.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I create the JavaScript variables requested in [JSXVariables.jsx](./Unsolved/src/components/JSXVariables.jsx).

* It's done when I render a `name` variable that will hold my name.

* It's done when I render the number of letters in the `name` variable.

* It's done when I create a variable called `thoughts` that contains a string regarding my thoughts on React.

## 💡 Hints

How can we use the [React Docs on JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) to help us while working with JSX?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What other array methods are available to use on the `name` variable?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
