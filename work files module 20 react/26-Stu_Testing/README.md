# 🏗️ Implement Tests to Ensure React Components Render Properly

## Activity

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to check whether my components render properly so that I can be confident when I ship the code for production.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have run `npm install pretty -D` inside my practice React app directory.

* It's done when I have imported the necessary components files into `*.test.jsx`.

* It's done when I create a test to check that each component renders properly on the page.

* It's done when I have created a test to see if each component matches the snapshot.

## 💡 Hints

How can you use the official [Vitest Docs on testing](https://vitest.dev/guide/snapshot.html) and [pretty](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pretty) to assist in this exercise?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What types of pitfalls can you and your partner think of that testing can help you avoid in web development?
