# 🐛 Event Handling in JSX

## Activity

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue:

* As a user, I want to be able to welcome some students to class by displaying their names in an alert along with a welcome message.

* As a developer, I want to allow my user to successfully click on the buttons in the browser.

## Expected Behavior

Clicking on any one of the buttons on the page should open an alert dialog box which says "Welcome `student`!" where `student` properly reflects the name which matches the button.

## Actual Behavior

The page immediately alerts a welcome message for each student and the buttons do not respond to clicks.

## 💡 Hints

* When registering event handlers, we pass a function reference to the browser, so that it can be invoked when the user interaction occurs on the specified element or elements. What are we doing here?

* The React Docs can be a helpful resource to consult if you are having difficulty identifying the issue.

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are some other events we can use with React elements?
