# üìñ Implement React-Router-DOM

## Activity

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to implement proper client-side routing.

* As a user, I want to initially see the homepage on load.

* As a user, I want to click to see About the developers.

* As a user, I want to be able to click to view the full profile data for a user.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when the proper imports have been brought into `main.jsx`, `App.jsx`, `/pages/HomePage.jsx`.

* It is done when `main.jsx` has a valid router defined.

  * The user should be able to see three unique pages
    1. The Home page
    2. The About page
    3. The Profile page
  
  * Additionally, when a routing error occurs (such as the user navigates to 'http://localhost:3000/banana'), the user should be shown an ErrorPage.

* It is done when `App.jsx` uses the proper React Router component to show a browser child route.

* It is done when `/pages/HomePage.jsx` links to each mock user's profile page.

* It is done when `/pages/ProfilePage.jsx` properly uses the useParams hook to fill in the API call for the individual user's profile data.
